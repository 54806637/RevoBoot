RevoBoot comes with configuration templates of which some you need to change:


ACPI/data-template.h
--------------------

RevoBoot's build process will copy this file for new configurations to the target modelidentifier 
and use it, but only when you didn't already do this yourself. Make all required changes in 
the new file only or it won't be used at all.

Note: We use 'factory tables' for the original ACPI tables in the BIOS and 'modified' 
      for new/modified ACPI tables.


EFI/data-template.h
-------------------

RevoBoot's build process will copy this file for new configurations to the target modelidentifier 
and use it, but only when you didn't already do this yourself. Make all required changes in 
the new file only or it won't be used at all.

Note: A simple HOWTO will (hopefully) soon be added to the EFI directory. 


SMBIOS/data-template.h
----------------------

RevoBoot's build process will copy this file for new configurations to the target modelidentifier 
and use it, but only when you didn't already do this yourself. Make all required changes in 
the new file only or it won't be used at all.

Note: You can extract the SMBIOS table data with: /smbios/tools/smbios2struct2 
      Make instruction are included in the source code.


settings.h
----------

This file selects the target settings file based on the specified model identifier. Using 
make MODEL=Macmini51 or use ./r Macmini51 (examples) makes it select RevoBoot/i386/config/SETTINGS/Macmini51.h
All future changes need to be made in this file, or they won't be picked up.


settings-template.h
-------------------

RevoBoot's build process first checks RevoBoot/i386/config/SETTINGS/*.h per target model identifier 
(example: Macmini51,h) and use it, or copies RevoBoot/i386/config/settings-template.h to the target model 
identifier (when the file is missing) to prevent build errors.

People with working RevoBoot configurations can simply copy their settings.h to SETTINGS/[your model].h 
This will allow the RevoBoot build process to compile without errors, but make sure to use the latest 
preprocessor options.

Important: Open settings-template.h and search for:

#define STATIC_NVRAM_ROM	{ 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08, 0x09, 0x0A, 0x0B, 0xNN, 0xNN, 0xNN, 0xNN, 0xNN, 0xNN } // Example only!
				// sudo nvram 4D1EDE05-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B38C14:ROM=%01%02%03%04%05%06%07%08%09%0A%0B%NN%NN%NN%NN%NN%NN
				// Note: Use your MAC address for the last six bytes!

You must change this, or RevoBoot won't compile!

ACPI/EFI/SMBIOS/data.h
----------------------

These are RevoBoot's main data selector files to support (optional) static data. 

Note: Do not change this file!
