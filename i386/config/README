RevoBoot comes with configuration templates of which some you need to change:


ACPI/data-template.h
--------------------

This file is optional. Only required when you want to inject static ACPI table data. 
Copy/rename the file to data.h and add your (modified) ACPI tables.

Note: We use 'factory tables' for the original ACPI tables in the BIOS and 'modified' 
      for new/modified ACPI tables.


EFI/data-template.h
-------------------

This file is optional. Only required when you want/need to inject EFI device properties. 
Copy/rename the file to data.h and add your EFI device properties.

Note: A simple HOWTO will (hopefully) soon be added to the EFI directory. 


SMBIOS/data-template.h
----------------------

This file is optional. Only required when you want to inject static ACPI table data. 
Copy/rename the file to data.h and add your static SMBIOS data.

Note: You can extract the SMBIOS table data with: /smbios/tools/smbios2struct2 
      Make instruction are included in the source code.


settings-template.h
-------------------

This is the default configuration template for RevoBoot. Every possible option can be found in it. 
You have to either copy or rename this file to settings.h and change it so that it matches your 
hardware configuration.


data-template.h
---------------

RevoBoot has one main include file for static data in the ACPI, EFI and SMBIOS directories. 
This enables you to add files for different target configurations there. Here's an example 
for two setups:

#include "ACPI/data-hp.h"
#include "EFI/data-hp.h"
#include "SMBIOS/data-hp.h"

or (not both):

#include "ACPI/data-asus.h" 
#include "EFI/data-asus.h" 
#include "SMBIOS/data-asus.h" 

Note: We plan to add a make option for this. To let it select the files for the target configuration.
