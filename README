About this project:
This Open Source hobby project is maintained by Pike and dgsga. Two long time supporters of the RevoBoot project.

Note that we do not tolerate/share any (links to) copyrighted material. We only use purchased software and we won't share any of it. Just get your copy of OS X in the Apple store. Should be affordable for everyone.

Mountain Lion Server:
RevoBoot has been confirmed to work with the Server app for Mountain Lion (12C60).

Fusion Drive Support:
Apple's new Fusion Drive* is a software implementation to speedup the boot and load process for frequently used applications, without limiting the storage capacity in a bad way. See also: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5446

The new Mac's that come with a Fusion Drive boot from the third (Recovery HD like) partition on the SSD. This partition is 134.2 MB in size and is called "Boot OS X".
The Recovery HD partition can be found as third partition on the HDD. Setting up a Fusion Drive on a Mac need to be done with Internet Recovery.

RevoBoot detects CoreStorage partitions and will boot from the boot helper partition on the SDD.

Xcode Support for Mountain Lion:
RevoBoot can be build on Snow Leopard, Lion and Mountain Lion. The latter requires Xcode 4.5.1 and a libcc_kext.a from an older version of Xcode. See change log for instructions.


Configuration:
Please note that RevoBoot must be configured for your hardware so start reading our WiKi. See also:

We also have a configuration README available at:

There's also RevoBuilder (a great tool for first starters) over at:
