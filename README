About this project:
This Open Source hobby project is maintained by Pike and dgsga. Two long time supporters of the RevoBoot project.

Note that we do not tolerate/share any (links to) copyrighted material. We only use purchased software and 
we won't share any of it. Just get your copy of OS X in the Apple store. Should be affordable for everyone.


Mountain Lion Server:
RevoBoot has been confirmed to work with the Server app for Mountain Lion (12C60).


Fusion Drive Support:
Apple's new Fusion Drive* is a software implementation to speedup the load process 
for frequently used applications, without limiting the storage capacity in a bad way.

RevoBoot has <i>not</i> yet been confirmed to work with a Fusion Drive. We however expect it to work flawlessly.


Xcode Support for Mountain Lion:
RevoBoot can be build on Snow Leopard, Lion and Mountain Lion. The latter requires 
Xcode 4.5.1 and a libcc_kext.a from an older version of Xcode. See change log for instructions.


Configuration:
Please note that RevoBoot must be configured for your hardware so start reading our WiKi. See also:

We also have a configuration README available at:

There's also RevoBuilder (a great tool for first starters) over at:

Note: RevoBuilder is most likeky broken for RevoBoot v.1.5.00 and greater!
